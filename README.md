# Atomic Sass

This is my Sass framework for generating Atomic CSS classes. These classes are created through Sass maps and have a `.as-` namespace that can be quickly replaced or removed by seeting it to an empty string.

### Setup

1. `yarn install` to get all the dependencies.
2. `yarn start` to compile the CSS and launch the test page.
